## Project Overview

**AuthLab** is a full-stack, web-based **authentication and security learning sandbox** designed to help learners understand how real-world web security works beyond theory.

Instead of hiding security logic behind frameworks, AuthLab intentionally **exposes internal flows**, **browser behavior**, and **backend decisions** so learners can observe how authentication, cookies, tokens, and authorization are enforced in practice.

The project was built as an **academic project**, using only free-tier services, modern web technologies, and production-grade security practices—while remaining simple enough for beginners to understand.

- **GitHub Repository**

## Motivation and Problem Statement

Web security concepts such as authentication, JWTs, cookies, and CSRF are often confusing for beginners because:

- Authentication feels like “magic”
- Cookies and tokens are invisible to users
- Attacks are described theoretically but never observed
- Frontend-only demos hide real backend enforcement

AuthLab solves this problem by providing a **safe, interactive environment** where learners can:
- Log in and out
- Trigger protected APIs
- Simulate attacks
- See exactly **why security checks succeed or fail**

---

## System Architecture Overview

![AuthLab Demonstrations](/images/projects/authlab/img_03.png)

AuthLab follows a **modern client–server architecture**:

### 1. Browser
- Renders the frontend UI
- Stores cookies automatically
- Sends cookies with every request based on browser rules

### 2. Frontend (Next.js)
- Runs JavaScript in the user’s browser
- Displays explanations, labs, and visualizations
- Calls backend APIs using `fetch`

### 3. Backend (Next.js APIs & Middleware)
- Executes on the server
- Reads cookies securely
- Enforces authentication and authorization
- Rejects unauthorized access

### 4. Supabase Authentication
- Validates user credentials
- Hashes passwords securely
- Issues signed session tokens
- Manages secure authentication cookies

### 5. Supabase Database (Optional)
- Stores audit logs
- Demonstrates backend logging and monitoring

---

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js (App Router)**
- React
- TypeScript
- Custom lightweight CSS

### Backend
- Next.js Route Handlers (`/app/api/*`)
- Next.js Middleware (Edge runtime)
- Server-side authorization checks

### Authentication & Security
- **Supabase Auth**
- JWT-based session validation
- HttpOnly cookies
- SameSite cookie protection

### Hosting
- **Vercel** (frontend + backend hosting)
- **Supabase** (authentication & database)
- Fully deployed using free tiers

---

## Authentication Flow Explained


1. User enters email and password
2. Browser sends credentials over **HTTPS**
3. Supabase:
   - Hashes the password
   - Verifies credentials
4. Supabase sets **HttpOnly authentication cookies**
5. Browser stores cookies automatically
6. On future requests:
   - Browser sends cookies automatically
7. Backend verifies session securely

Important security guarantees:
- Passwords are never stored in plaintext
- Tokens are never accessible to JavaScript
- All communication is encrypted using HTTPS

---

## Key Security Concepts Demonstrated

### Cookies
- HttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed via JavaScript
- Secure cookies are sent only over HTTPS
- SameSite cookies control cross-site behavior

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- JWT structure: `header.payload.signature`
- Payload is readable
- Signature prevents tampering
- JWT verification happens **on the server**

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Browsers send cookies automatically
- Attackers exploit this behavior
- SameSite cookies prevent cross-site abuse

### Authorization (RBAC)
- USER vs ADMIN roles
- Backend enforces access control
- Frontend bypass attempts always fail

### Hashing vs Encryption
- Passwords are **hashed** (one-way)
- Network traffic is **encrypted** (two-way via TLS)
- JWTs are **signed**, not encrypted

---

## Simulated Role-Based Access Control

AuthLab includes a **simulated role system** for learning purposes.

- Role stored in a secure HttpOnly cookie (`sim_role`)
- Learners can switch between USER and ADMIN
- Backend enforces role checks

This design allows:
- Role testing without multiple accounts
- Clear visualization of authorization logic

> ⚠️ Note: This is strictly for education. Real applications must store roles securely in databases or JWT claims.

---

## Middleware and Route Protection

Next.js Middleware runs **before** requests reach pages or APIs.

AuthLab uses middleware to:
- Protect `/dashboard` and `/admin`
- Redirect unauthenticated users
- Demonstrate real server-side enforcement

This ensures:
- Security is not dependent on frontend logic
- Unauthorized requests are blocked early

---

## Hosting and Deployment Strategy

### Frontend & Backend Hosting
- Hosted on **Vercel**
- Automatic HTTPS
- Continuous deployment via GitHub

### Authentication & Database
- Hosted on **Supabase**
- Secure by default
- Free tier sufficient for educational usage

### Environment Configuration
- Supabase URL
- Supabase anonymous public key
- Securely stored in Vercel environment variables

---

## Educational Value and Learning Outcomes

After using AuthLab, learners gain a practical understanding of:
- How login systems actually work
- Why cookies matter for security
- How CSRF attacks are blocked
- Why JWT tampering fails
- How backend authorization is enforced

AuthLab bridges the gap between **theoretical security knowledge** and **real-world implementation**.

---

## Conclusion

AuthLab is more than a demo—it is a **hands-on security learning platform** that demonstrates how modern authentication and authorization systems work in practice.

The project showcases my ability to:
- Design secure architectures
- Implement real authentication flows
- Deploy production-ready applications
- Explain complex security concepts clearly

AuthLab represents a complete, end-to-end system built using modern tools, strong security principles, and free hosting infrastructure.
